# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my software is functional and secure it is important to review and test the core functionality of the software.
To ensure functionaility it is imparitive to test the core functionaility of the components of the software. This way you can ensure that each module behaves as expexted and can hanlde all other use cases the system may handle. This ensures the software behaves as expected, and handles all of the necissary use cases, ensuring functionality and security. 

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The most important step in interpereting a client or user needs into a program is requireing all of the necissary requirements for the system. Gathering all of the expected functional and buisness requirements when in communication with a user or client ensures that you require all of the necissary context for the system. This way you can talk into account the requiremnets for the system in the design of the system and implement these requirements into developing the software including all of the neccisary user needs. 

# How do I approach designing software?

When approaching the design of a software it is important to gain knowlege and context on who the software is for, the purpose of the software and to gather all of the neccisary requirements for the system. This means full communication between the developer and the client or users who will be using the software. Now that you have the requirements for the system, the purpose of the system and have researched any addtional functionality for the software or what the software is trying to solve, now you can start the design process, ensuring the design alligns with the specified requirements and goals.
